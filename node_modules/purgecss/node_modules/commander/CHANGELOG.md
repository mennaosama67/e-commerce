* display help for missing subcommand, by default ([#1088] [#1149])
* combined short options as single argument may include boolean flags and value flag and value (e.g. `-a -b -p 80` can be written as `-abp80`) ([#1145])
* `.parseOption()` includes short flag and long flag expansions ([#1145])
* `.helpInformation()` returns help text as a string, previously a private routine ([#1169])

* implicit help command works with command aliases ([#948] [#1149])
